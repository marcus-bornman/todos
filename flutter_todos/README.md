This is an implementation of the [Todos Application](../README.md) using the Flutter framework. The
application consists of an Android and iOS application. All applications are protected using email and 
authentication with Firebase Authentication; and, data is persisted using a Firestore NoSQL database.

### Built With
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. A few resources to get you started if this is your first
Flutter project:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
  For more help getting started with Flutter, view the [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers
  tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Also, note that this app makes use of Firebase. Hence, you will need to configure each of the apps with
your Firebase project details - see the relevant documentation for [Android Installation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/installation/android)
and [iOS Installation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/installation/ios).


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Run the app [in the way your IDE describes](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive).
You should see either Android, iOS, or web output, depending on your device.
