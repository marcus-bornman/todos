This project contains a simple Todos application built with multiple different frameworks. The purpose of the project
has been to provide me with a space to learn each of the frameworks as well as to demonstrate my skills using these frameworks.

The domain for the Todos application is the same across the different frameworks and is depicted in the diagram above. Essentially,
registered users have the ability to manage multiple todo lists which each may have multiple todo items.

While the domain is the same across the different frameworks used to implement the application, different means of security,
persistence and client-side exposure have been implemented for each framework. The specifics of these approaches are detailed
within the sub-repositories themselves

### Built With
Currently, the Todos application has been implemented using each of the frameworks below:
* [Spring](https://spring.io)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
This repository serves as a mono-repo for each of the different frameworks used to implement the Todos application components.
To get started with individual frameworks see the sub-folders in this repo:
* [Todos using Spring](/spring_todos)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Again, depending on the framework used to implement the Todos application, the usage examples will differ.
